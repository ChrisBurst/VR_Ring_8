# VR_Ring_8
Test using Oculus Rift that has participants follow sounds and search for lights in a ring or sphere.

More specifically, the participant (wearing Oculus Rift and headphones) will be surrounded by a ring or sphere of lights. A light will turn on and emit a sound. The participant will need to find the light and press any button while looking at the light. Time it takes to find each light will be recorded in an output file. The order the lights come on will be determined by an input file.
