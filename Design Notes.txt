Wait until participant presses button to begin test.

Begin timer
Make an overall timer and a time elapsed since light turned on timer

LOOP{
wait 1 second, turn on first light in array
Output to file the time

if(hitbox is touching ON light AND Participant presses button)
	Light flashes green
	chime is heard
	Output to file time, and that light was found
	Light shuts off
	One second later next light in array turns on


if(hitbox is NOT touching ON light AND participant presses button)
	//Light could flash red, but in this situation the participant can't see the light so
	//any effect is lost
	Buzzer is heard (3D from light's source)
	Output to file time, and that light was missed
	//Do not turn off light. Light will stay put until found
}

Questions:
Is it possible for two lights to be on at a time? If so a way to tell which light the participant is looking at will be needed.

Light should turn off when participant sees it. Accompany a chime (no 3D sound) to let them know it is confirmed.




NOTE:
Need to overwrite output file at start of every test
